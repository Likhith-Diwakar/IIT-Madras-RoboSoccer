## **Robot Components**

### **1. Motor Drivers**
We used motor drivers to control the speed and direction of the motors, ensuring smooth and precise movement during gameplay.

### **2. Arduino Mega**
The Arduino Mega served as the brain of the robots, managing the signals from the receivers and executing the control logic.

### **3. 3S Battery Source**
A 3S LiPo battery was used as the primary power source, providing ample energy for the motors and electronics.

### **4. Acrylic Sheets**
Acrylic sheets were utilized to construct the frame of the robots, offering a lightweight yet sturdy structure.

### **5. Receivers**
- **FS-i6:** Used for controlling the Defender Robot.
- **FS-i10B:** Used for controlling the Attacker Robot.
